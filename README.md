In this exploratory data analysis(EDA) project on a large Netflix dataset using Python we focused on understanding the trends and patterns within Netflix's content library.
We utilised the popular libraries such as NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming the dataset into a more usable format.
For visualization, we leveraged Matplotlib and Seaborn to generate plots and graphs, allowing us to explore trends.
Through this EDA, we gained insights into Netflix's catalog and how its content varies through different categories.
